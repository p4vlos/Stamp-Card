# ShareTea Rewards - A reward cards app I built for the company [ShareTea](http://www.shareteacerritos.com/) to be used in an app that tracks loyalty points.


The app is overall very simple, but is relevant to the company as it saves them money by having them not print rewards/loyalty cards and buy stamps/ink.

- Has a password verification system before storing loyalty points.
- Stores info via CoreData


Here is what my final xcode setup looks like:

Your stamp is saved even if you close the app. Just make sure to not delete the app or your stamps wont be saved!

Referencing the image above, if you press the "Redeem" button, the store employee has to input their super secret password. Look at the following image below.

When the customer finally acquired 10 stamps, the "Redeem" button shows up for them to get their free drink! After pressing the button, the drink stamps will reset to 0.
